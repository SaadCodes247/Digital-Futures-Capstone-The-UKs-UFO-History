# Digital Future's Capstone Project - The UK's UFO History!

## Background:

### Situation:

Since I was a child, I have loved all things sci-fi and mystery-related, whether it was reading books, watching documentaries, or watching shows on the Discovery Channel! I knew that a dataset existed for unidentified flying objects (UFO) sightings in the UK, and I have always been curious about it, which is why I decided to explore it and explain the history to my audience.

### Task:

My main goal was to entertain and inform my audience of the UK's UFO sighting history, both so that they were more aware of the history and to make the subject less daunting to discuss if needed in the future.

This was successfully accomplished by creating an entertaining presentation which utilised natural language processing (NLP) techniques on over 6000 reportings by people from 1980 to today! 

### Data

There were 3 main sources of data to create this project: 

  1. UK UFO reports from 1997 to 2009:\
     https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ufo-reports-in-the-uk
     
  2. The National UFO Reporting Center's database from the early 1900s to today:\
     https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=cUnited_Kingdom

  3. The British Earth and Aerial Mysteries Society (BEAMS) UFO report database:\
     https://www.beamsinvestigations.org/ufo-reports.html

## Outcome!

Having analysed 6000 sightings, I created an entertaining data journalism piece on the UK's UFO history for my Digital Futures capstone project!

This was a great experience that taught me how to approach presenting text information using NLP to an audience, which was a brand new presentation style for me!

## Bonus:

If anyone at Netflix happens to be reading this, please make a show about it! And don't forget to credit me!
